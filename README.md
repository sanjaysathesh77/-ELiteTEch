####### 1. Data Pipeline Development Goal: Build an automated ETL pipeline to clean, transform, and prepare data.

Tools Used: Pandas, Scikit-learn

Features:

Data loading (CSV/Excel)

Missing value handling

Feature encoding (Label Encoding, One-Hot)

Data scaling (MinMaxScaler, StandardScaler)

Exporting cleaned data to CSV or feeding it into models

Deliverable: data_pipeline.py or data_pipeline.ipynb

2. Deep Learning Model
Goal: Implement a deep learning model for image classification or NLP task.

Frameworks Used: TensorFlow or PyTorch

Example Tasks:

Image classification using CNN (e.g., MNIST, CIFAR-10)

Text classification using LSTM or Transformers

Visualizations:

Training vs. validation accuracy/loss plots

Confusion matrix, classification report

Deliverable: image_classification_model.py or nlp_model.py

3. Model Deployment with Flask or FastAPI
Goal: Deploy the trained model as a REST API.

Tools Used: Flask or FastAPI

Features:

/predict endpoint to accept input and return predictions

Input validation

JSON responses

Optional: Web UI for testing

Deliverable: app.py, main.py, or api.py

Hosted App: Deployed via Render, Railway, or Streamlit Cloud (optional)

4. Business Problem Solving with Optimization (Linear Programming)
Goal: Solve a business scenario like maximizing profit using limited resources.

Tools Used: PuLP, Matplotlib

Problem Example:

Optimize product mix based on constraints (machine hours, labor)

Get max profit and resource allocation

Outputs:

Optimal production strategy

Visuals of constraints vs solution

Summary of unused resources
